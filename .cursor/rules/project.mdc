<project-description>
Here we creating app (game) to test user agains pairs of some Mandarin Chinese words and hanzi's.

<key-term>Mistaken pair is a pair of two words or two hanzi, that user can easily confuse one with other. Technically, for each pair we have data tuple - (hanzi1, pinyin1, hanzi2, pinyin2), where hanzi is Chinese charecters of word/hanzi 1 or 2, and pinyin is pinyin with tone mark. So, in our game we train user to tell the difference by showing randomly hanzi with correct or incorrect pinyin and get user to check. </key-term>
<key-term>Training mode is a gaming mode where score does not count, and when player answers incorrectly - we immediately show correct answer as a short term alert. Training session is limited 50 elements.</key-term>
<key-term>Survival mode is a gaming mode where session is not limited and score count. Score is just amount of correct answers in a row. First incorrect answer ending the game session. So it's like roguelike mechanics.</key-term>

Application consists of screens
<screen-1>Starting screen, with big buttons: "Training", "Survival".</screen-1>
<screen-2>Game screen. Appears when user press "Start" button. Game loop is following: we randomly show a card with hanzi text with correct pinyin or pinyin from paired hanzi text. User should swipe right if pinyin is correct or swipe left if incorrect. We should count user score based on correct answers and the speed of answering. User score should be presented as large integer in the screen corner. </screen-2>
<screen-3>Settings screen. List of pairs, user can edit each pair by pressing the pencil button or delet by pressing trash button. Editing is implemented as modal with fields Hanzi1, Pinyin1, Hanzi2, Pinyin2. Also user add new pairs by clicking add button on this screen. </screen-3>
