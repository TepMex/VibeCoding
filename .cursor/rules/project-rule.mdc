Application consists of screens
<screen-1>Text input screen: large textarea input, where user can paste arbitrary text.</screen-1>
<screen-2>Report screen. Some data about complexity of the text from screen-1</screen-2>
<screen-3>Configuration screen, where user can create, edit or delete some hanzi lists.</screen-3>
<screen-4>Hanzi map screen. Shows all the hanzi from screen-1 text as a map of chinese syllables.</screen-4>

<key-term>Hanzi list is arbitrary string consists of hanzi characters.List has name and type. Type can be "inclusive" or "exclusive". Inclusive lists - hanzi that participate in complexity calculation, exclusive - hanzi that excludes from complexity calculation</key-term>
