<project-description>
Here we create Progressive Web App audio player for language learners.

<feature-1>Wrapper for Open AI Whisper tiny multilingual WASM. Wrapper should provide simple API to model like `async transcribe(audioData, language?): Promise<string>` to get text from part of the mp3 audio file. All model files and WASM files should be stored locally, our app should work withour internet (no CDN downloads in runtime).</feature-1>
<feature-2>User should upload text of the book on foreign language, available formats is epub, html, txt, fb2. App should extract text from file and create index for fast fuzzy searching.</feature-2>
<feature-3>User should upload mp3 audio of that book. Our app should provide common features of audio player, like play/pause buttons, go back/forward 15 seconds buttons.</feature-3>
<feature-4>When user press stop button, app should get the last N seconds of audio that user listen, create transcript using our feature-1, then fuzzy search this location in the book text, and scroll to this fragment. It's like audio-to-text syncronization on demand.</feature-4>
<appearance>Application consists of just one screen, in the top part of the screen should be placed audio player controls, and two selectors - for text and for audio. Bottom part (about 2/3 of screen) - render of the book text.</appearance>
