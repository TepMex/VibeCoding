We should prepare our data for English and Russian language to format like this
[
    {hanzi: "你", meanings: ["you", "you#r", "you#rs]},
    ...
]

Use frequency dictionary from ./data/hanzi-frequency.csv
Extract English meanings from ./data/unihan-kdefinition.txt (kDefinition field)
Extract Russian meanings from ./data/BKRS. Data is stored in Youmichan format.

We should do something with variability of words (suffixes), maybe using some morphology libraries for English and Russian.
