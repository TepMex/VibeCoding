<project-goal>We creating application to help learning Chinese language, by easier memorising of the separate hanzi's meanings. Hanzifier is a Chrome extnension to change English or Russian text on current web page. Hanzifier replace some words on the page to hanzi, according to hanzi meaning.</project-goal>
<example>
    <text>What do you think about that?</text>
    <hanzified-text>What do 你 想 about that?</hanzified-text>
</example>
<data-structure>
We should use json data with structure like this:
[
    {hanzi: "你", meanings: ["you", "you#r", "you#rs]},
    ...
]
So for each hanzi we store array of possible meanings, where # is special characted indicating that suffix after the # should not be replaced.
you -> replace to 你
your -> replace to 你r
yours -> replace to 你rs，
etc
</data-structure>
<feature-1>
Extension should extract text from currently open web page in Chrome, find words that can be replaced to hanzi, and then replace it in place.
</feature-1>
<feature-2>
Hanzi in our data should be sorted by frequency, and greedy algorithm should be used to replace. We should use frequency dictionary for that task.
</feature-2>
<feature-3>
User should be able to toggle our extension on/off by clicking on the extension icon in Chrome extension bar.
</feature-3>
<feature-4>
Settings. We should create settings page for our extension, where user can select hanzi lists for replacing. Hanzi lists should be based on frequency and contain 100 hanzi each. Like List 1 - 100 most frequent hanzi, List 2 - 100 hanzi next by frequency, etc. User should enable/disable lists by checkboxes in settings.
